Multi-Threaded Web Server in C++
Overview
This project implements a basic multi-threaded web server in C++ that handles multiple client requests concurrently. 
It is designed to serve static HTML files. The server listens on port [8080] (http://localhost:8080/) by default and processes each client request in a separate thread.

Features
Multi-threading: Each client request is handled by a separate thread using the C++ Standard Library's std::thread.
Socket Programming: The server uses the Winsock API for network communication.
Static File Serving: The server responds with the content of index.html or a 404 Not Found page if the file does not exist.
Basic HTTP Response: The server responds with a simple HTTP 200 OK response for valid requests.

Prerequisites
Windows OS (The server uses the Winsock API, which is specific to Windows).
C++ Compiler: Make sure your environment has a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher.
Winsock2 Library: The project links against the Ws2_32.lib library.


How It Works
->Initialize Winsock: The server starts by initializing Winsock using WSAStartup.
->Create Server Socket: A server socket is created using the socket() function, and it is bound to an IP address and port using the bind() function.
Close Connections: Once the response is sent, the server closes the client socket.

File Structure
server.cpp: The main server code which is task4.cpp,
index.html: The default HTML file served by the server.
